# ZPL-O-Rama

This repo contains a front-end server which interfaces with an also included RESTful backend server to:

1. Print a ZPL to a label
2. Take a picture of that ZPL after printing
3. That's it

A demo is available online at _HAHAHA LIKE I'M LETTING YOU JACKALS HAVE ACCESS TO HARDWARE THAT USES ACTUAL PHYSICAL RESOURCES_.

See [my blindingly brilliant blog post series](https://www.jasonscheirer.com/tags/zpl-o-rama/) for more information.
